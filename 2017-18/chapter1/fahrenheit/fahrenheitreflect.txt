:   Fahrenheit was my second program that I have evaluated this school year. When it comes
to the programming process, I thought about converting temperatures in general, the process I
would have to take to plug in the value of x and evaluate. After I found the formula, the next
thing I ask myself is how would a program give me the output of a conversion. I used a calculator
and the website Wolfram Alpha to get a better sense of converting one unit to another. For me
to make a program, I’d looks for demos and teach myself to dig deep and understand how the
units are being converted.
	After checking out multiple references, I began to think from a computer’s perspective.
For me to convert C to F, I would have to ask the user to give an input, since I am trying to convert
from C to F. In class, I learned about floats, and integers. A float value gives me a rational number
in decimals while an integer gives me an integer. You get the picture. So, I used the variable float
to ask the input to be in decimal format. I asked the user to put in the temperature in C. Next, I
defined another float where this new float evaluates the user’s input through a formula, and
eventually have an output in F.
	I used float for the formula to convert C to F because my answer would be in decimal
points, which doesn’t follow the definition of an integer. Eventually, I used the printf() function
to print out the final output for the user to see. Since the program requirement told me to go up
to 1 decimal place, I did so. As a result, this is how I evaluated my second program: Fahrenheit.
