:   The purpose of initials is to print out the first letter of each name
we input. In other words, if my input was Sirius Black, my output would be SB.
Since this is not a command-line input, my main function is void. The name is a
string, so I used the datatype string to get a name as the user input. Then, I
implemented a if statement to make sure that the input does not represent an
error when trying to execute the code. Next, I used a printf to print out the
first character in upper case. Next, I implemented a for loop to print out the
first letter of the second word. I used a if statement to check the condition
has a space or a end of argument (\0). These 2 condtitions will check for a
space not an end of the argument then print out the next letter after the name.
I used a toupper function to make my letters uppercase because the program
specifications told us so. Then, my output would print out the first character
of each word in uppercase.
    This is how I made Initials.
