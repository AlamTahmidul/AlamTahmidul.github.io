:   Programming websites are one of the best ways to store all of your information online. This tells the job market and college
that you are very organized and can provide with relevant information upon request. While websites, itself, are like a online
cloud storage for your life, creating one is one of the steps you would take in order to become organized. I have made a website
before, but that was 3 years ago when I really used to code back then. Games diverted my attention away, but who cares. Making the
website again was fun because I was able to display my true self online and was able to really customize the way my website looks.
While this website was for a class assignment, I kept the information to a minimum, to show some basic understanding of how
I am able to code with logic and with a plan.
    Of course, every coding experiences comes with frustration. I struggled with centering an image on the webpage (before I was
introduced to CSS Grid). I had to use margin: auto; on both left and right to center the image. I experienced other problems as well,
such as calling a custom font from the link (not from Google Fonts). To fix this issue, I downloaded the font and imported it into
my Cloud9 library. Then, I called up the function in my HTML file. After I re-ran the website, the custom font loaded, and all
was fixed. Other errors such as changing colors were simple fixes (I had the color name misspelled). After all the errors were
fixed, my website was ready to be handed in. All that's left is putting a link and add a list. I incorporated these final touches
and finished creating my website. This is how I made my website.
