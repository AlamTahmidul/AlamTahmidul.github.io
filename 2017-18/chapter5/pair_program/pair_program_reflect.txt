:
1. How did you enjoy the pair programing experience?
    The pair programming experience was really fun. Even though my partner knew a lot of new concepts that I didn't know about,
    the opportunity of learning new things and overcoming obstacles was really enjoyable.
2. Did you feel you had equal time with your partner acting as driver and navigator?
    I did have equal time with my partner acting as driver and navigator. While I was in charge of handling the HTML/CSS portion
    of the program, my partner was able to provide feedback on my work when I struggled. I wasn't able to stay on par with my
    partner but I did manage to give advice rather than code to help out with the coding process.
3. Do you feel the project ended up with higher quality code?
    The project did end up with higher quality code because while the JavaScript was 317 lines, the use of classes and constructors
    were a good way to store player and enemy information (health, strength, etc.). The CSS involved centering images, creating
    a CSS Grid, and the layout of the game. These qualities were really thought well and made well.
4. Do you feel you learned the same, less, or more while working with a partner?
    I learned more while working with a partner. No matter what partner I have, I would most likely learn something new, as I would
    learn a new thing my partner researched that I haven't found yet. With little research and vigorous collaboration, I am bound to
    learn something new while working with a partner.
