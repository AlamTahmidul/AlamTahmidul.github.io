:   When I was using JavaScript, there were few commands that stuck with me since I started coding 4 years ago. Back in 7th grade,
I used to edit .apk files and "mod" offline android games. While the computer language for .apk was not necessarily JavaScript, but
it had the same logical process. JavaScript opened up "movements" that HTML or CSS did not provide (obviously, as these 2 only
focus on styling, not the movements itself). I can actually order the computer or a server to get a request using a few lines of code
and add an "addEventListener" for mouse clicks, keys pressing, and other forms of action. Soon, I stopped coding as I moved onto
Python and focused less on JavaScript.
    Anyways, that was enough of my "experience" with JavaScript. After I was reintroduced to this for this assignment, I was able
to recognize a few commands such as console.log(), var [name], and others. While I was remembering my previous days of using
JavaScript, I forgot how fun it was to be able to code and tackle hard and challenging problems. Temperature happened to be one of
the challenging problems (as I stopped coding in JavaScript). However, in the first semester, when I was introduced to C, we had
to code to make a temperature conversion. I had some experience beforehand, so I only had to implement the same steps I took in C
into JavaScript. The frustrating part about temperature is that we needed an addEventListener which can only happen when clicked on
the submit button. Calling the submit button in JavaScript was a struggle as I needed to do: document.getElementbyID("#submit") to
get submit. Then I had to use this to my Event Listener. After I incorporated elements of HTML into JS, and plugged in the formulas,
I was able to create temperature. This is how I made temperature.
