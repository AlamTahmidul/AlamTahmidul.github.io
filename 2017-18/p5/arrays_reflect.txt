:   Creating multiple bubbles using an array is really easy. Since you only have to change how many bubbles you want to make in the
canvas, using an array would give you a straightforward answer. Arrays can store very big numbers and are very efficient in keeping
a long list of items together. To create the array of bubbles, I defined an array called bubbles and put [] around it. This refers
to a blank error because I didn't place anything in there. However, you can add arrays with a p5 convention called push. This
command would place a new array into the data after the previous one and so forth. I placed them in the setup, inside a for loop,
and defined new x, y, and r based on my bubble class and a constructor function. In doing so, all I had to do was change the
number of bubbles I wanted in the for loop, and the overall change would be implemented. After I finished creating a basic foundation
of bubbles, I began to explore extensions to the bubbles assignment. I had a hard time implementing a bounce function. After receiving
help from the p5 references page, I was able to implement the bounce function. I added speed and used if statements to check for
colliding with the edges of the canvas and reverse acceleration.
    This is how I made Bubbles: arrays.
