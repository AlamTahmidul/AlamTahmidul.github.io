2a. I made the program “bleep” in Python with a purpose for censoring banned words. The program gets an input from the user and
checks if the input has any banned words listed in the ‘banned.txt’ file. If there is, then the program censors the banned word
with *s. Then, the program prints out the user input with the words censored.

2b.This program was done independently and with a lot of trial and errors. I checked for the user input (the number of commands the user inputted). If there are more than or less than 2 command line arguments, the program exits with a code 1. Otherwise, the input is invalid and the program is ready to censor the words. The program splits up the text into lists. Then, the program creates an empty set of banned words from the .txt file in the 2nd command line input. The program opens the files and for each element inside, the program adds the elements to the set. Then with a loop, the program checks if there are any banned words in the user input. If there is, the program censors the banned word(s) with *s and prints out the user input with the censored word. But, if the text had any banned words attached, then the program should not censor part of the word. To avoid this, I used a counter, c, to loop through the list and get the word and its length. Then I print out * based on the length. Then, the program joins the list and prints the result.
