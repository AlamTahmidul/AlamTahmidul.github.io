# Train Stations

This program checks train scheduling. The user can create/delete stations and place trains that are running on schedule. If there is a conflict in time in the same track (the time could be the same on a different track), the user gets prompted that the time poses a conflict. The output shows a table of the list of stations, tracks, utilization rate, arrival, and departure time.
