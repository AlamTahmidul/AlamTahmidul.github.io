:   To start with Greedy, I looked at Zamyla's walkthrough and thought about a pseudocode that would aid me in creating
greedy. I thought about the user input and the program specs said to convert the user input to completely into cents.
The reason being that as my input is a datatype of float, there is the concept of floating point imprecision. Floating
point imprecision describes that the given input value is not precise, as the datatype float assumes that the user
rounded off to the number in the input. By converting to cents, this imprecision is dodged and the code would run
precisely and accurately. The biggest challenge in creating greedy was creating the equations I needed in order to
succesfully launch the code.
    While working independently, I found that there were errors present in my lines of code. To fix this error, I
looked at the terminal window and tried understanding the problem I was having and then resolving the issue. If there
was a bug, I'd implement the code debug50 to go through my code step by step. Another way I'd debug my code is by
using eprintf. With eprintf, I was able to look at the value I would have after each increment of a loop finishes and
prints. During the process, I was able to find out a new skill: executing a code without a forever loop. It is good
to find different ways to solve the code, that is just logic. I thought about the process of setting up my code,
so all I have to do now is to make the code that I am thinking about. Eventually, after trials of errors, I was able
to construct the program greedy.
    In conclusion, this is how I made Greedy,
