:   ISBN validates a 10-digit ISBN Number. To create this program, I must first find an algorithm that must check
each digit of the ISBN number. To do so, I used a for loop to repeat the multiple things. First, I wanted to deal with
the last digit of the ISBN code. I used isbn % 10 to give me that last digit. Then, I would multiply this last digit by
10, then the next digit by 9 and so forth until the first digit is multiplied by 0. Then, I would sum up the results
from these products. Before the end product comes, I used a for loop to repeat the previous descriptions about the
digits such that the program repeats itself 10 times rather than put 10 different sets of lines of code. Next, I used
a if-else conditional to check if the sum of these products mod 11 would give me 0, according to the program
specifications. If it did, it would print "YES", otherwise the print would be "NO". In creating the program, I messed up
on multiplying the last digit by 10. Instead, I multiplied by 0 then worked my way back where I multiply the first digit
by 10, which is the opposite of what I was supposed to do. So, instead of i++ and i = 0, I changed it to i-- and i = 10.
This is how I created ISBN.
