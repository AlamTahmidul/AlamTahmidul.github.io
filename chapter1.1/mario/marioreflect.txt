    Mario was a really tricky program to create. I had to implement nested for loops to establish my goal. My goal was
to implement a program that would print out a pyramid starting with 2 ## and ending with whatever the height was (based
on the user input). First, I defined my variables outside my for loop (as they will be global variables, not local tem-
porary variables. I used the variable half_pyramid_height to act as a user input for the height of the half-pyramid I
am about to print out with the function printf(). I used a do-while loop to reprompt my user if he or she did not meet
the conditions I had to set for the program (accepted height values 0 < x < 24, so 23 distinct integer values). I used
a for loop outside as practically pressing enter after the inside loops finished their for loops to separate out the
pyramid blocks in each height. I used a inside for loop to be used as spaces. This is because at row 1, my # (or pyramid
block) needs to be spaced out the outermost right based on the user input. Then, I implemented another forever loop
inside the 'pressing enter' loop but not inside the 'space' loop to print out the block, #. I used pyramid < i + 2 to
tell the program that at row 1, you would start off with 2 blocks, then 3. In other words, instead of starting with 0
blocks, I am starting with 2 blocks. As a result, I put all these ideas together and created Mario.
    In conclusion, this is how I made Mario.
