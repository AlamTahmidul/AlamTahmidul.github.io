<assignmentname>Calc Reflection</assignmentname>
:   Calc is a program created to function as a calculator. To start calc, I used
switch to create multiple cases of inputs (+, x, -, /, %). First, I checked if the
input was valid; the argument count is 4, and the sign of operation (argv[2][0]) is
either +, x, -, /, or %. If it didn't, then return an error (return 1). Then I
initialized my variables as the input to be argv[2] and a varible sign with datatype
char as input[0] or the ASCII numerical value of the sign (+, x, -, /, %) because
all arguments have an end of command \0 that tampers with argv[2] only. So, I
implemented argv[2][0] in a broader sense. Now, I used switch with sign that detects
the ASCII values of signs and does whatever each case were telling them (if add then
add the first number (argv[1]) and the second number (argv[3]), if multiply then
multiply the first number (argv[1]) and the second number (argv[3]), and so on). For
the modulo, I had to implement a special scenario as mod only works with ints in C.
I said that I would divide the 2 numbers first and declare the answer in an int
datatype (in the variable called mod). Then, I would print the float by taking the
first number and subtracting it to the product of the mod and the second number. Then,
my program was complete.
    This is how I made Calc.
