1. What is a JavaScript object?
    A JavaScript object is a physical property that we are trying to create. In other words, a car is considered to be an object.
We can use the object car and talk about the properties of the car (e.g. the brand, the color, the type).
2. What is the advantage of using objects?
    Using objects help save local properties into a variable. In the example of the car, we can create an object called car and
store some parameters like the color, the type, and others. In doing so, we can access these parameters that are saved. In this
assignment, we have to refer back to local saved information in order to make our object come to life with p5.js.
3.  Did you have any struggles implementing this program, or understanding how to use objects?
    Creating objects were really easy for me. The struggles I had were implementing a class and a constructor function since this
is my first time working with p5. After I viewed a tutorial with Dan Shiftman from NYU, I was able to learn about classes and
implementing constructor functions. The constructor function pretty much creates the object for me when I say new
object(parameters). In such a manner, I was able to create my bubbles animation.
